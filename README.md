# Industrial-Smart-Agriculture
This is a prototype-based project that incorporates IoT technology for soil monitoring in agriculture industry. 
The hardware components consist of ESP32 microcontroller as the backbone of the system, industrial-grade soil sensors for measuring the soil parameters such as soil moisture, EC temperature, NPK etc.
The IoT network setup integrates MQTT messaging protocol to facilitate data transfer from devices to IoT platforms such as Datacake as used
in this project to display the data on dashboards available both on mobile and web applications.
